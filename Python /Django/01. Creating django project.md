1. pre required package:
   python must be installed in the local system from official website. check the python version to verify it.
   ```
   python --version
   ```
   output: python version is shown
    
2. use the venv file to overcome the admin level issue with django admin vs local admin
   ```
   python -m venv <env_name>
   <env_name>\Scripts\activate
   ```
   Creates a new virtual environment directory named <env_name>. This isolates project dependencies from global Python packages.
   Activates the virtual environment on Windows systems. On Linux/macOS, the command is typically source <env_name>/bin/activate.
   output: <env_name>/bin/activate
3. commands to create a django project:
   ```
   python -m pip install Django
   django-admin --version
   django-admin startproject <project_name>
   cd <project_name>
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The primary commands for a basic Django project setup as noted are:
python -m venv <env_name>: Creates a new virtual environment directory named <env_name>. This isolates project dependencies from global Python packages.
<env_name>\Scripts\activate: Activates the virtual environment on Windows systems. On Linux/macOS, the command is typically source <env_name>/bin/activate.
python -m pip install Django: Installs the Django framework within the activated virtual environment.
django-admin --version: Verifies the installed Django version.
django-admin startproject <project_name>: Creates the main project directory and necessary configuration files (like settings.py, urls.py, and wsgi.py).
cd <project_name>: Changes the current directory to the newly created project folder.
python manage.py runserver: Starts the Django development server on your local Machine, usually at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. 

4. Key Files and Their Uses
The project structure includes several core files:
manage.py: A command-line utility for administrative tasks. It acts as a wrapper around django-admin, setting the correct DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable for your project.
settings.py: Contains all the configuration and settings for your Django project.
urls.py: The "table of contents" or URL dispatcher that maps requests to their corresponding views.
asgi.py & wsgi.py: Entry points for ASGI and WSGI compatible web servers, used for deployment in production environments.
__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python to treat the directory as a Python package.
db.sqlite3: The default SQLite database file used for development purposes. 


5. creating apps in django: modules
**python manage.py startapp (filename)**: This command is used to create a new, separate application within a larger Django project. Django applications are modular and designed to handle specific parts of a website, such as user authentication or product listings.
```
python manage.py startapp (filename)
```

file structure: 
**__init__.py** : An empty file that tells the Python interpreter that the directory is a ##python package##.
**admin.py** : This file is used to register models so they are visible and manageable within the Django administrative interface.
**apps.py** : Contains configuration for the application itself.
**models.py** : Defines the data structure (models) for the application, which correspond to database tables. This is where you define fields and relationships.
**tests.py** : Contains code for writing and running test cases for the application's functionality.
**views.py** : Contains the logic for handling web requests and returning responses, often interacting with models to retrieve data and templates to format the output. 
The project files also include asgi.py and wsgi.py, which are entry points for web servers to communicate with the Django application using asynchronous and synchronous protocols, respectively.
