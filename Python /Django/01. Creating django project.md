🐍 Django Project Setup – Step-by-Step Guide

This document explains the basic setup, commands, and file structure required to create and run a Django project in a structured and beginner-friendly manner.


---

1. Prerequisite: Python Installation

Before working with Django, Python must be installed on your local system.

🔹 Install Python

Download Python from the official website:
👉 https://www.python.org

During installation, check “Add Python to PATH”.


🔹 Verify Python Installation

Run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

python --version

✅ Output

Python X.Y.Z

This confirms Python is installed successfully.


---

2. Virtual Environment (venv)

A virtual environment is used to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between:

Django admin permissions

System-level Python packages

Multiple Django projects


🔹 Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv <env_name>

Creates a new virtual environment directory named <env_name>

Keeps project dependencies separate from global Python packages


🔹 Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows:

<env_name>\Scripts\activate

On Linux / macOS:

source <env_name>/bin/activate

✅ Output (Example)

(<env_name>)

This indicates the virtual environment is active.


---

3. Creating a Django Project

Once the virtual environment is activated, follow these steps.

🔹 Install Django

python -m pip install Django

🔹 Verify Django Installation

django-admin --version

🔹 Create a Django Project

django-admin startproject <project_name>

🔹 Navigate to Project Directory

cd <project_name>

🔹 Run the Development Server

python manage.py runserver

🌐 Access the Application

Open your browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/


---

4. Primary Commands Summary

Command	Purpose

python -m venv <env_name>	Creates a virtual environment
<env_name>\Scripts\activate	Activates virtual environment (Windows)
python -m pip install Django	Installs Django framework
django-admin --version	Confirms Django installation
django-admin startproject <project_name>	Creates a Django project
cd <project_name>	Enters project directory
python manage.py runserver	Starts Django development server

5. Key Project Files and Their Uses

After creating a project, Django generates the following core files:

📁 Project Structure

<project_name>/
│
├── manage.py
├── <project_name>/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── wsgi.py
│
└── db.sqlite3

📄 File Descriptions

manage.py

Command-line utility for administrative tasks

Acts as a wrapper around django-admin

Sets the correct DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE


settings.py

Contains all project configuration

Database, installed apps, middleware, templates, security settings


urls.py

URL dispatcher (routing system)

Maps URLs to views


asgi.py

Entry point for ASGI-compatible servers

Used for asynchronous applications (WebSockets, async views)


wsgi.py

Entry point for WSGI-compatible servers

Used in traditional synchronous deployments


init.py

Marks the directory as a Python package


db.sqlite3

Default SQLite database

Used mainly for development and testing



---

6. Creating Applications (Modules) in Django

Django projects are divided into apps, each handling a specific functionality.

🔹 Create a New App

python manage.py startapp <app_name>

📁 App File Structure

<app_name>/
│
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
├── views.py

📄 App Files Explanation

init.py

Marks the app directory as a Python package


admin.py

Used to register models

Makes models accessible in Django Admin Panel


apps.py

Contains application configuration


models.py

Defines database models

Each model maps to a database table


views.py

Contains request-handling logic

Returns HTTP responses (HTML, JSON, etc.)


tests.py

Used to write and run unit tests



---

7. ASGI & WSGI in Apps

Although apps do not directly contain ASGI/WSGI files, the project-level:

asgi.py → Asynchronous server interface

wsgi.py → Synchronous server interface


These files enable Django to communicate with production web servers.
