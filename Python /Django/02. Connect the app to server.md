# 🔗 Connecting a Django App to the Server (URL → View → Response)

This document explains **how to connect a Django app to the Django server** so that the app can respond to web requests.  
It covers **app registration, URL configuration, views, and request flow** in a clear, step-by-step manner.

---
## 0. Creating Applications (Modules) in Django

Django projects are divided into apps, each handling a specific functionality.

Create a New App
```
python manage.py startapp <app_name>
```


## 1. Understanding the Django Request Flow

When a user accesses a URL in the browser, Django processes the request in the following order:

Browser → Project urls.py → App urls.py → views.py → Response

---

## 2. Registering the App in the Project

After creating an app, it must be **registered** with the Django project.

### 🔹 Step 1: Open `settings.py`

Path:

<project_name>/settings.py

### 🔹 Step 2: Add App to `INSTALLED_APPS`

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    '<app_name>',   # Add your app here
]
```
✅ This allows Django to recognize and load the app.


---

3. Creating a View (Server Logic)

Views handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses.

🔹 Step 1: Open views.py

Path:

<app_name>/views.py

🔹 Step 2: Create a View Function
```
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django App is connected!")
```
📌 This view returns a simple response to confirm server connectivity.


---

4. Creating App-Level URLs

Each app should have its own urls.py file.

🔹 Step 1: Create urls.py in App Folder

Path:

<app_name>/urls.py

🔹 Step 2: Define App URL Patterns
```
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```
'' → Default URL of the app

path has 3 parameters. ("url", "views functions", "name")

views.home → Function that handles the request

name='home' → URL name used for reverse lookup



---

5. Connecting App URLs to Project URLs

Now link the app’s URLs to the main project URL configuration.

🔹 Step 1: Open Project urls.py

Path:

<project_name>/urls.py

🔹 Step 2: Include App URLs
```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('<app_name>.urls')),   # App connected to server
]
```
✅ This connects the app to the Django server.


---

6. Running the Server

Start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

🌐 Access in Browser

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

✅ Output

Hello, Django App is connected!

This confirms the app is successfully connected to the server.

7. App–Server Connection Summary

Component	Purpose
```
python manage.py startapp <app_name> | application or module creation 
INSTALLED_APPS	| Registers the app
views.py	      | Handles request logic
app/urls.py 	  | Maps URLs to views
project/urls.py	 | Connects app URLs to server
runserver	      | Starts the Django server
```


---

8. Common Errors & Fixes

❌ App Not Found Error

✔ Ensure app name is added to INSTALLED_APPS

❌ 404 Page Not Found

✔ Check URL patterns in both urls.py files

❌ Import Error

✔ Verify correct app and file names


---

9. Conclusion

You have successfully learned how to:

Register a Django app

Create views

Configure app-level URLs

Connect the app to the Django server

Serve responses through the browser


This is a core concept required for:

Django interviews

Real-world projects
