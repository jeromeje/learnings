### Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

---

Select All Columns

SELECT * FROM employee;


---

Select Specific Columns

SELECT emp_id, name, salary
FROM employee;


---

3. DISTINCT Keyword

Purpose

Removes duplicate values.

SELECT DISTINCT dept
FROM employee;

📌 Used mainly in reporting and analytics


---

4. WHERE Clause

Purpose
