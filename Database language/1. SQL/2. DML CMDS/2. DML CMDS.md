# SECTION 2: DML COMMANDS (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

---

## 1. What is DML?

**DML (Data Manipulation Language)** is used to **insert, modify, and delete data** in database tables.

- DML commands affect **table data**
- DML commands **can be rolled back**
- Used frequently in **real-time applications**

---

## 2. INSERT Statement

### Purpose
Adds new records (rows) into a table.

---

### Syntax 1: Insert All Columns
```sql
INSERT INTO employee
VALUES (101, 'Jerome', 45000, 'IT');
```

---

Syntax 2: Insert Selected Columns

INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, name, dept)
VALUES (102, 'Arun', 'HR');


---

Syntax 3: Insert Multiple Rows

INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, name, salary, dept)
VALUES
(103, 'Ravi', 50000, 'Finance'),
(104, 'Anu', 42000, 'IT');


---

Syntax 4: INSERT INTO SELECT

INSERT INTO employee_backup
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE dept = 'IT';


---

Interview Notes – INSERT

Column order must match value order

Missing columns take DEFAULT or NULL

INSERT INTO SELECT copies data from another table



---

3. UPDATE Statement

Purpose

Modifies existing records.


---

Syntax

UPDATE employee
SET salary = 55000
WHERE emp_id = 101;

⚠️ Without WHERE, all records will be updated


---

Update Multiple Columns

UPDATE employee
SET salary = 60000, dept = 'Admin'
WHERE emp_id = 104;


---

Update Using Subquery

UPDATE employee
SET salary = salary + 5000
WHERE dept IN (
    SELECT dept FROM department WHERE location = 'Chennai'
);


---

Interview Notes – UPDATE

Always use WHERE clause

Can update using subqueries

Affects only matched rows



---

4. DELETE Statement

Purpose

Removes records from a table.


---

Syntax

DELETE FROM employee
WHERE emp_id = 103;


---

Delete All Records

DELETE FROM employee;


---

Delete Using Subquery

DELETE FROM employee
WHERE dept IN (
    SELECT dept FROM department WHERE location = 'Mumbai'
);


---

5. DELETE vs TRUNCATE vs DROP (VERY IMPORTANT ⭐)

Feature	DELETE	TRUNCATE	DROP

Removes Data	Yes	Yes	Yes
Removes Structure	No	No	Yes
WHERE Clause	Yes	No	No
Rollback	Yes	No	No
Speed	Slow	Fast	Fastest



---

6. Transactions with DML

Example

BEGIN;

UPDATE employee SET salary = 70000 WHERE emp_id = 101;
DELETE FROM employee WHERE emp_id = 104;

ROLLBACK;

✔️ Changes will be undone


---

Key Points to Remember

INSERT adds data

UPDATE modifies data

DELETE removes data

Always use WHERE with UPDATE & DELETE

DML supports transactions
