# SECTION 7: SQL SET OPERATORS

---

## 1. What are Set Operators?

**Set operators** are used to **combine the results of two or more SELECT queries**.

📌 They work on the concept of **set theory**  
📌 Each SELECT statement must return the **same number of columns**

---

## 2. Rules for Using Set Operators (INTERVIEW FAVORITE ⭐)

1. Same number of columns in each SELECT
2. Same data types in corresponding columns
3. Column order must be the same
4. ORDER BY can be used only at the **end**

---

## 3. Types of Set Operators

| Operator | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| UNION | Combines results and removes duplicates |
| UNION ALL | Combines results and keeps duplicates |
| INTERSECT | Common rows |
| EXCEPT / MINUS | Rows from first query not in second |

---

## 4. UNION

### Definition
Combines result sets and **removes duplicate rows**.

---

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column FROM table2;
```

---

Example
```
SELECT name FROM employee_2023
UNION
SELECT name FROM employee_2024;
```
✔️ Duplicate names removed


---

5. UNION ALL

Definition

Combines result sets and keeps duplicate rows.


---

Example
```
SELECT name FROM employee_2023
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM employee_2024;
```
✔️ Faster than UNION
❌ Duplicates allowed


---

6. INTERSECT

Definition

Returns common rows between two SELECT queries.


---

Example
```
SELECT emp_id FROM employee_2023
INTERSECT
SELECT emp_id FROM employee_2024;
```
📌 Supported in Oracle, PostgreSQL
📌 Not supported in MySQL (use JOIN)


---

7. EXCEPT / MINUS

Definition

Returns rows present in first query but not in second.


---

Example (PostgreSQL / SQL Server)
```
SELECT emp_id FROM employee_2023
EXCEPT
SELECT emp_id FROM employee_2024;
```

---

Example (Oracle)
```
SELECT emp_id FROM employee_2023
MINUS
SELECT emp_id FROM employee_2024;
```

---

8. Using ORDER BY with Set Operators
```
SELECT name FROM employee_2023
UNION
SELECT name FROM employee_2024
ORDER BY name;
```
📌 ORDER BY applies to final result only


---

9. UNION vs UNION ALL (VERY IMPORTANT ⭐)

Feature	UNION	UNION ALL

Removes duplicates	Yes	No
Performance	Slower	Faster
Sorting	Required	Not required


📌 Prefer UNION ALL when duplicates are acceptable


---

10. SET OPERATORS vs JOINS (INTERVIEW FAVORITE ⭐)

Feature	Set Operator	JOIN

Combines	Rows	Columns
Relationship	Not required	Required
Performance	Moderate	Faster



---

Key Points to Remember

Set operators work only with SELECT

UNION removes duplicates

UNION ALL is faster

INTERSECT & EXCEPT not supported in MySQL

Column count & data type must match
