Your task is to generate a COMPLETE, EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND,

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE to build a BASIC WEB APPLICATION

for absolute beginners.



STRICT RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):

1. Follow the EXACT section order given below.

2. Use VERY SIMPLE ENGLISH (no complex technical words without explanation).

3. Explain EVERYTHING step by step, assuming the learner is new.

4. Show BOTH explanation and simple code examples.

5. Use the SAME technology stack for everyone:

   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

   - Backend: Node.js + Express

   - Database: MongoDB

6. Do NOT skip any section.

7. Keep the output STRUCTURED and DETERMINISTIC

   so everyone gets the same learning flow.
